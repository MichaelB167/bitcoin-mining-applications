# Bitcoin Mining Applications

Everyone has heard of bitcoin and some of you have probably made transactions with it, perhaps as a payment method or a speculative investment.

About a year ago, I was talking with a friend and trying to explain why I  felt confident investing a retrospectively dumb percentage of my net worth in it.  I understood the basic principles of how it operated as a digital currency, but as I tried explaining even the basics of encryption and the mining process all that was coming out was the bitcoin equivalent of 'webscale brah'.

This talk will succinctly compile the bits and pieces I've learned since then to answer the above, as well as go into a bit more detail on how bitcoin relates to subjects we've covered in class such as cs data structures and network funcionality.

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should:

-   Understand the basic principles of cryptocurrencies and more specifically bitcoin.
-   See parallels between bitcoin mining networks and cs data structures that we've seen in class
-   Be able to mine sample bitcoins via the command line in a sandbox p2p environment.
-   Hopefully not be on an NSA watchlist or have inadvertently committed any cyber crimes.

## Bitcoin Basics

Bitcoin was invented by a man named Satoshi Nakamoto as a way to mitigate fraud in online transactions.  He postulated that the current system of relying on financial institutions as third parties to process transactions is risky because it introduces a significant need for trust between parties.  Bitcoin instead allows two parties to interact directly with each other based on cryptographic proof

## Demo: Write a Demo

Demos are demonstrations, and developers should give their full attention to
them. It's a great time for them to take notes about important concepts before
applying them in an exercise.

Demos correspond to the "I do" portion of scaffolding from consultant trainging.

## Exercise: Write an Exercise

During exercises, developers should apply concepts covered in the previous demo.
This is their first chance to generalize concepts introduced. Exercises should
be very focused, and flow natural into a lab.

Exercises correspond to the "We do" portion of scaffolding from consultant
trainging.

## Lab: Write a Lab

During labs, developers get to demonstrate their understanding of concepts from
demos and applied knowledge from exercises. Labs are an opportunity for
developers to build confidence, and also serve as a diagnostic tool for
consultants to evaluate developer understanding.

Labs should be timed explicitly using a timer. When estimating the time it will
take to complete a lab, it is better to overestimate. During labs, consultants
should circle the room and interact with developers, noting patterns and
prompting with hints on how to complete the lab. If developers end early, a
consultant may stop the lab timer. If developers do not finish in time, a
consultant may give more time at her discretion based on current talk pace, the
current estimate for the talk, and the importance of completing the lab while
consultant support is available.

Labs correspond to the "You do" portion of scaffolding from consultant
trainging.

## TL;DR

## Additional Resources

-   Any useful links should be included in the talk material where the link is
    first referenced.
-   Additional links for further study or exploration are appropriate in this
    section.
-   Links to important parts of documentation not covered during the talk, or
    tools tangentially used but not part of the focus of the talk, are also
    appropriate.
